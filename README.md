### Tech Talk

PART ONE

1. Practiced creating dynamic web pages using AJAX
2. Practiced requesting a data from a web api endpoint and then sending that data to a web page as a response to the request
3. LIMITATION OF AJAX: Ajax cannot switch protocols for example from http to https. This is why I've shown this project via a video demo instead of my normal github page url

PART TWO
1. Practiced creating a PROMISE and getting a result out of a PROMISE
2. Practiced creating a promise instance using Promise() constructor
3. Practiced defining what should happen when the PROMISE is fulfilled or rejected

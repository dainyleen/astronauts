### Tech Talk
1. I've learned how to use ajax to create web pages dynamically
2. I've learned how to request a data from a web api endpoint and then send that data to a web page as a response to the request
3. LIMITATION OF AJAX: Ajax cannot switch protocols for example from http to https. This is why I've shown this project via a video demo instead of my normal github page url
